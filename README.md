# Overview

As a software engineer eager to expand my skill set and deepen my understanding of programming languages, I undertook a project to demonstrate proficiency in Rust. The software I developed is a command-line tool that showcases various features of the Rust language, including variables, expressions, conditionals, loops, functions, and memory management principles.

My purpose in writing this software was twofold: to solidify my understanding of Rust syntax and concepts, and to create a tangible project that highlights my abilities as a Rust developer. Through this project, I aimed to demonstrate my proficiency in Rust and showcase my ability to write clean, efficient, and idiomatic Rust code.

# Development Environment

To develop this software, I utilized the following tools:

- **IDE**: Visual Studio Code with Rust Analyzer for syntax highlighting, code completion, and linting.
- **Build Tool**: Cargo, Rust's package manager and build tool, was used for managing dependencies and building the project.
- **Version Control**: Git for version control, with GitHub for hosting the repository.

The programming language used for this project is Rust. Additionally, I utilized several Rust libraries, including `std` for standard library functionality and potentially other crates as needed for specific functionalities within the project.

# Useful Websites

During the development of this project, the following websites proved to be valuable resources:

- [Rust Documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/)
- [Rust Reddit Community](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/)
- [Rust by Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/)

# Future Work

While the current version of the software accomplishes its primary goals, there are several areas for future improvement and enhancement:

- Refactor code to improve readability and maintainability.
- Implement additional features to further demonstrate Rust language capabilities.
- Add error handling and robustness to improve the software's reliability.
- Expand test coverage to ensure the software's correctness and stability.
- Enhance documentation to provide clearer instructions and explanations for users and contributors.
